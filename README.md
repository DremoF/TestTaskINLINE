Test Task for INLINE
//----------------------------//
Tasks:

1. Create a database schema for storing records and comments to them. Place SQL queries for creating a database in a separate file. (test.sql file)

2. Create a PHP script that will download the list of posts and comments to them and load them into the database. Upon completion of the download, display in the console the inscription: "Loaded X records and Y comments" (ParserScript.php file)

3. Create an HTML form for searching records by comment text (input field and "Find" button). Example: when you type "laudanti" you want to display all the posts that have this line in the comments. The search should work when you enter at least 3 characters. In the search results, display the title of the entry and a comment with the search string. (index.php file)
